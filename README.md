## Introduction

Welcome to this organized learning path and resource collection.

The materials are all organized in sections based on specific topics. There is no order to follow. You can skim through all the sections, look for anything specific, follow only a few sections, or just start reading from the very beginning to the end. It's your choice!

I am willing to keep this study path always updated, and I would invite you to contribute by submitting any material you believe will improve it.
